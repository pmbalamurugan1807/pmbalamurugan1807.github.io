## 📂 Projects

### 🔹 Order Data Analysis
**Tech:** Streamlit, SQL Server, Excel, Python
- Cleaned and preprocessed `orders.csv` in Excel by renaming columns and replacing blank/N/A values with 0.
- Uploaded the cleaned dataset into **Microsoft SQL Server** as `dbo.orders`.
- Wrote multiple SQL queries in `GUVIproject1orders.sql` as part of project requirements.
- Built a Streamlit application (`relatilorderanalysis.py`) that connects to SQL Server and displays each SQL query and its output via an interactive dropdown interface.


### 🔹 Agri Data Explorer
**Tech:** Python, EDA, Power BI  
- Analyzed **50 years of Indian agricultural data** sourced from ICRISAT.
- Delivered an interactive BI dashboard comparing production of **23 major crops** across states.
- Helped identify trends, patterns, and statewide performance differences.

  
### 🔹 Employee Attrition Analysis
**Tech:** Streamlit, Python, Scikit-learn, Random Forest
- Entire project implemented in a single Python file (**employeeattrition.py**).
- Preprocessed `Employee-Attrition.csv` using binary encoding, one-hot encoding, and removed non‑informative columns.
- Built a multi-page Streamlit application with:
  - **Dataset Overview** – Displays data summary, missing values, and distribution insights.
  - **EDA & Visualization** – Includes attrition bar charts, gender-based attrition, performance rating counts, and a correlation heatmap.
  - **Model Training & Evaluation** – Trains a RandomForestClassifier (80/20 split), showing accuracy, precision, confusion matrix, and feature importance chart.
  - **Predict Attrition** – Allows user input to estimate the probability of an employee leaving.
  - **Predict Performance Rating** – Uses RandomForestRegressor to predict employee performance rating.
- Provided multiple visualizations such as bar graphs, heatmaps, and performance metrics to fully analyze employee behavior and prediction outcomes.


### 🔹 Multiple Disease Prediction
**Tech:** Python, Streamlit, Machine Learning  
- Built ML models to detect Indian liver disease, kidney disease, and Parkinson's disease.
- Achieved **>0.78 precision** using Random Forest and other algorithms.
- Designed a clean, user-friendly interface for medical data input.

### 🔹 NLP Sentiment Analysis
**Tech:** Streamlit, Python, NLP
- Built a complete NLP Sentiment Analysis system in a **single Python file (`aiecho.py`)**.
- Preprocessed the `chatgpt_style_reviews_dataset.csv` dataset using **stemming and lemmatization**.
- Designed a multi-page Streamlit interface with:
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - **Sentiment Analysis Insights**
  - **Model Training and Evaluation**
  - **Try Your Own Review**
- **EDA Page:** Displays all EDA visualizations with interactive selection via dropdown.
- **Sentiment Insights Page:** Answers project-specific analytical questions using visualizations.
- **Model Training Page:** Trains Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest models using an 80/20 split with metrics such as accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix.
- **User Input Prediction:** Allows users to input a review and choose one of the three models to get sentiment predictions.



### 🔹 Personal UPI Usage & Financial Analyzer (LLM-powered)
**Tech:** Python, Streamlit, HuggingFace, GPT-4o-mini, Data Cleaning, Visualization  
- Built an interactive dashboard for personal financial insights.
- Provided spending patterns, budgeting assistance, and automated recommendations using LLM integration.
